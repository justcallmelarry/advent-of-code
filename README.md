# aoc2022

My solutions for AoC2022.

Running in a virtual environment where I add my tools folder to pythonoath to access the utils script.\
Run `source config.sh` to add tools to your PYTHONPATH. Also requires you to have your session token in a file called token.txt in the root dir.\
It also adds the current year (don't forget to update it!) to an env variable for use in different scripts.


Uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.

Use `new-day.py 01` to set up the first day of 2019.
