# Advent of Code

My solutions for AoC!

Running in a virtual environment where I add my tools folder to pythonoath to access the utils script.\
Add `export PYTHONPATH=/Users/lauri/code/advent-of-code/tools:$PYTHONPATH` to the venv's activate file (probably `/Users/lauri/.venvs/advent-of-code/bin/activate`).\
Update the path as needed.
