# Advent of Code

My solutions for AoC! Generally do a solution myself first, then look up what others have done and refactor my own solution on order to learn how to do them better in the future.

Running in a virtual environment where I add my tools folder to pythonoath to access the utils script.\
Add `export PYTHONPATH=/Users/lauri/code/advent-of-code/tools:$PYTHONPATH` to the venv's activate file (probably `/Users/lauri/.venvs/advent-of-code/bin/activate`).\
Update the path as needed.

Uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
